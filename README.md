This repository provides a structured set of filtering rules to classify and organize media releases based on release groups and formats. It is designed to categorize media sources across various tiers for Remux, Bluray, and WEB releases, along with a dedicated section for WEB Scene releases.

Each filter is defined by regular expression patterns that capture specific release groups, enabling automated sorting and tagging. The rules are grouped into three tiers for each media type, reflecting the quality and characteristics of the release.
